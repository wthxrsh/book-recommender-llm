🚀 Excited to share my latest project: Semantic Book Recommender! 📚✨

This AI-powered application goes beyond simple keyword matching to understand the meaning and emotional vibe of what you want to read.

💡 What it does:
*   Semantic Search: Find books by describing a plot, theme, or feeling (e.g., "A story about redemption").
*   Emotion Filtering: Sort recommendations by mood—Happy, Sad, Suspenseful, Angry, etc.
*   Smart Discovery: Powered by vector embeddings to find the best conceptual matches.

🛠️ How it works:
1.  Vector Search: Uses LangChain and ChromaDB to convert book descriptions into vectors and match them with your query.
2.  Sentiment Analysis: A DistilRoBERTa transformer model analyzes the emotional content of every book in the dataset.
3.  Interactive UI: A sleek Gradio dashboard lets you filter by category and tone in real-time.

💻 Tech Stack:
*   Language: Python 🐍
*   AI/NLP: LangChain, HuggingFace Transformers, ChromaDB
*   Data: Pandas, NumPy
*   Interface: Gradio
